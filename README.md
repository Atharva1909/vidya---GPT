## Introduction
This project leverages advanced AI techniques to generate questions for SSC (Secondary School Certificate) exams. The primary goal is to assist educators and students by providing a robust tool for creating diverse and comprehensive question sets.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing models to generate SSC exam questions.
- **Dataset Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with datasets provided by YouData.ai.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to customize question generation parameters for tailored outputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided by [YouData.ai](https://datalink.youdata.ai/2p8v4nef). It includes a comprehensive collection of SSC exam questions categorized by topics and difficulty levels.

    cd ssc-question-generation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To generate questions, run the following command:
```bash
python generate_questions.py --input dataset.csv --output questions.txt
```

Replace `dataset.csv` with your dataset file and `questions.txt` with the desired output file name.
